,GUIDELINES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,ID,Guideline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,1,All options should be grammatically consistent with the stem and should be parallel in style and form. Non-grammatically correct options provide cues to the students who easily eliminate distracters that do not flow grammatically with the stem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2,Each MCQ should have a clear and focused question. Teachers should avoid using MCQs with unfocused stems which do not ask a clear question or state a clear problem in the sentence completion format.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,3,"Each MCQ should have the problem in the stem of the question, not in the options. The options should not be a series of true/false statements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,4,"The basic format for MCQs is the single best answer. Therefore, ensure that questions have one, and only one, best answer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,5,"Avoid gratuitous or unnecessary information in the stem or the options. If a vignette is provided with the MCQ, it should be required to answer the question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,6,"Avoid complex, or K-type MCQs. K-type MCQs have a range of correct responses and then ask students to select from a number of possible combinations of these responses. Students can often guess the answer by eliminating one incorrect response and all options containing this response or by selecting the responses which appear most frequently in all of the options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,7,"Questions and all options should be written in clear, unambiguous language. Poorly worded or ambiguous questions can confuse even knowledgeable students and cause them to answer incorrectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,8,Make all distracters plausible as plausible distracters are vital to high quality MCQs. Students who do not know the material increase their chances of guessing the correct option by eliminating implausible distracters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,9,Avoid repeating words in the stem and the correct option. Similar wording allows students to identify the correct option without knowing the material.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,10,Avoid providing logical cues in the stem and the correct option that can help the student to identify the correct option without knowing the material. An example of a logical cue is asking students to select the most appropriate pharmaceutical intervention for a problem and only having one or two options which are actually pharmaceutical interventions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,11,Avoid convergence cues in options where there are different combinations of multiple components to the answer. Question writers tend to use the correct answers more frequently across all options and students will identify as correct the answer in which all components appear most frequently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,12,"All options should be similar in length and amount of detail provided in the option. If one option is longer, includes more detailed information, or it contains more complex language, students can usually correctly assume that this is the correct answer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,13,"Arrange MCQ options in alphabetical, chronological, or numerical order. (We assess for chronological and numerical, but not alphabetical order).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,14,"Options should be worded to avoid the use of absolute terms (e.g., never, always, only, all) as students are taught that there are often no absolute truths in most health science subjects and they can therefore eliminate these distracters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,15,"Options should be worded to avoid the use of vague terms (e.g., frequently, occasionally, rarely, usually, commonly) as these terms lack precision and there is seldom agreement on the actual meaning of ‘‘often’’ or ‘‘frequently’’.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,16,"Avoid the use of negatives (e.g., not, except, incorrect) in the stem as they poorly assess students actual knowledge. If teachers wish to assess contraindications, the questions should be worded clearly to indicate that this is what is being assessed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,17,"Avoid the use of ‘‘all of the above’’ as the last option. Students can easily identify if this is the correct answer by simply knowing that at least two of the options are correct. Similarly, they can eliminate it by knowing if only one of the options is incorrect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,18,"Avoid the use of ‘‘none of the above’’ as the last option as it only measures students’ ability to detect incorrect answers. Furthermore, if ‘‘none of the above’’ is the correct option, the teacher must be certain that there are no exceptions to any of the options that the student may detect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,19,Avoid fill-in-the-blank format whereby a word is omitted in the middle of a sentence and the student must guess the correct word. All options should be placed at the end of the stem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metalloids have some properties of metals (elements that can conduct electricity) and some properties of nonmetals (elements that cannot conduct electricity). For example, most metalloids can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals. Metalloids also tend to be shiny like metals, but brittle like nonmetals. Chemically, metalloids may behave like metals or nonmetals, depending on their number of valence electrons.

Water vapor rises from Earth’s surface into the atmosphere. As it rises, it cools. The water vapor may then condense into water droplets and form clouds. If enough water droplets collect in clouds, they may come together to form droplets. The droplets will fall as rain. This how freshwater gets from the atmosphere back to Earth's surface.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,6,What is the conversion of a solid to a gas called?,What is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas,sublimation,speciation,amplification,education,"['dilution', 'condensation', 'dilution']","(a) Sublimation is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas (much lesser density). This process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (c) The process in question is dilution. The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter. The process may also yield a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop, zero in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,7,What creates new seafloor in the rift valleys?,What creates new seafloor in the rift valleys?,seafloor spreading,sedimentation,crust spreading,continental drift,"['volcanoes', 'islands', 'hotspots']","Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge.

,10,What is telomere shortening associated with?,What is the term for telomere shortening associated with?,aging,sleeping,reducing,changing,"['cell division', 'cell division', 'cell division']","Telomerase is not active in adult somatic cells. Adult somatic cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened. This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. In 2010, scientists found [1] that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice, and this may have potential in regenerative medicine.

They filter all the blood in the body many times each day and produce a total of about 1.5 liters of urine. The kidneys control the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine. The kidneys also secrete hormones that help maintain homeostasis. Erythropoietin, for example, is a kidney hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when more are needed. The kidneys themselves are also regulated by hormones. For example, antidiuretic hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the kidneys to produce more concentrated urine when the body is low on water.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,12,A ramp is a type of simple machine called what?,What type of machine is a ramp?,inclined plane,extension plane,allow plane,rough plane,"['incline plane', 'sloped plane', 'inclined machine']","Look at the ramp in the Figure below . A ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane. It can be used to raise an object off the ground. The input distance is the length of the sloped surface of the ramp. This is the distance over which the input force is applied. The output distance is the height of the ramp, or the vertical distance the object is raised. For this ramp, the input distance is 6 m and the output distance is 2 meters. Therefore, the ideal mechanical advantage of this ramp is:.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The lens and other structures of the eye work together to focus a real image on the retina. The image is upside-down and reduced in size, as you can see in Figure below . The image reaches the brain as electrical signals that travel through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the signals as shape, color, and brightness. It also interprets the image as though it were right-side up. The brain does this automatically, so what we see is always right-side up. The brain also “tells” us what we are seeing.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Waves of light are represented by arrows called rays. Rays that strike the surface are referred to as incident rays, and rays that reflect off the surface are known as reflected rays. In regular reflection, all the rays are reflected in the same direction. This explains why regular reflection forms a clear image. In diffuse reflection, the rays are reflected in many different directions. This is why diffuse reflection forms, at best, a blurry image. You can see animations of both types of reflection at this URL: http://toolboxes. flexiblelearning. net. au/demosites/series5/508/Laboratory/StudyNotes/snReflectionMirrors. htm.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Every living thing needs energy to live and grow. Your body gets its energy from food, but that is only a small part of the energy you use every day. Cooking your food takes energy, and so does keeping it cold in the refrigerator or the freezer. The same is true for heating or cooling your home. Whether you are turning on a light in the kitchen or riding in a car to school, you are using energy. Billions of people all around the world use energy, so there is a huge demand for resources to provide all of this energy. Why do we need so much energy? The main reason is that almost everything that happens on Earth involves energy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,32,The primary motor cortex is located in which lobe of the brain?,The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the what lobe,frontal,Parietal,Temporal lobe,Occipital,"['lateral', 'medial', 'somatosensory']","Primary Motor Cortex The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. A neurosurgeon, Walter Penfield, described much of the basic understanding of the primary motor cortex by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebrum. Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that he could observe responses to the stimulation. This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. We now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction. The primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see Figure 14.23). The neurons responsible for musculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure. The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. Also, the relative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest amount of cortical space is given to muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers and the lower face. The “power muscles” that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,33,"Horny ridges on the jaws serve the same function as what, for turtles?",What do turtles use to cut and chew food?,teeth,skin,taste buds,hairs,"['teeth', 'horns', 'a rigid beak']","Turtles may appear slow and harmless when they are out of the water, but in the water is another story. Turtles can be either herbivores or carnivores, with most sea turtles carnivorous . Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous, or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does have some limitations. Sea turtles typically feed on jellyfish, sponges and other soft-bodied organisms. Some species of sea turtle with stronger jaws eat shellfish, while other species, such as the green sea turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated ridges that help them cut through tough plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Biochemistry is the study of the chemicals that make up life. Cell biology is the study of life at the level of the cell. Microbiology is the study of microscopic organisms. Immunology is the study of an organism's resistance to disease. Genetics is the study of how organisms pass traits to their offspring. The study of how the human body works is called physiology. Zoology is the study of animals. The study of how organisms interact with their environment and each other is called ecology. Evolutionary biology is the study of how populations and species change over time. Botany is the study of plants.

Echinodermata are exclusively marine organisms. Sea stars (Figure 28.44), sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms. To date, no freshwater or terrestrial echinoderms are known. Morphology and Anatomy Adult echinoderms exhibit pentaradial symmetry and have a calcareous endoskeleton made of ossicles, although the early larval stages of all echinoderms have bilateral symmetry. The endoskeleton is developed by epidermal cells and may possess pigment cells, giving vivid colors to these animals, as well as cells laden with toxins. Gonads are present in each arm. In echinoderms like sea stars, every arm bears two rows of tube feet on the oral side. These tube feet help in attachment to the substratum. These animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system. An interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate, even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (c) The process in question is dilution. The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter. The process may also yield a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop, zero in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,32,The primary motor cortex is located in which lobe of the brain?,The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the what lobe,frontal,Parietal,Temporal lobe,Occipital,"['lateral', 'medial', 'precentral']","Primary Motor Cortex The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. A neurosurgeon, Walter Penfield, described much of the basic understanding of the primary motor cortex by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebrum. Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that he could observe responses to the stimulation. This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. We now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction. The primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see Figure 14.23). The neurons responsible for musculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure. The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. Also, the relative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest amount of cortical space is given to muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers and the lower face. The “power muscles” that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Turtles can be either herbivores or carnivores, with most sea turtles carnivorous . Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous, or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does have some limitations. Sea turtles typically feed on jellyfish, sponges and other soft-bodied organisms. Some species of sea turtle with stronger jaws eat shellfish, while other species, such as the green sea turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated ridges that help them cut through tough plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,
