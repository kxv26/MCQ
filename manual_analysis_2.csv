3,What causes symptoms associated with sickle-cell disease?,,pleiotropic effects,genetic drift,spontaneous mutation,transgene effects,,"Metalloids are the smallest class of elements, containing just six members: boron (B), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and tellurium (Te). Metalloids have some properties of metals (elements that can conduct electricity) and some properties of nonmetals (elements that cannot conduct electricity). For example, most metalloids can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals. Metalloids also tend to be shiny like metals, but brittle like nonmetals. Chemically, metalloids may behave like metals or nonmetals, depending on their number of valence electrons. You can learn more about specific metalloids by clicking on the element symbols in the periodic table at this URL: http://www. chemicool. com/ ."
4,What is the purpose of a bird using flashy displays?,,to attract mates,to protect their territory,to dissuade predators,to signal feeding,,Birds often use flashy displays to attract mates.
5,What happens to water vapor as it rises?,,it cools,it warms,it vibrates,it disperses,,"The image below shows the role of the atmosphere in the water cycle ( Figure below ). Water vapor rises from Earth’s surface into the atmosphere. As it rises, it cools. The water vapor may then condense into water droplets and form clouds. If enough water droplets collect in clouds, they may come together to form droplets. The droplets will fall as rain. This how freshwater gets from the atmosphere back to Earth's surface."
6,What is the conversion of a solid to a gas called?,,sublimation,speciation,amplification,education,,"(a) Sublimation is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas (much lesser density). This process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (c) The process in question is dilution. The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter. The process may also yield a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop, zero in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout."
7,What creates new seafloor in the rift valleys?,,seafloor spreading,sedimentation,crust spreading,continental drift,,"Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge. Seafloor spreading creates new seafloor in the rift valleys. This type of volcanism makes all of the ocean floor! Where a hotspot is located along the ridge, such as at Iceland, volcanoes grow high enough to create islands ( Figure below )."
8,Where do mushrooms get their energy?,,decomposing dead organisms,killing organisms,accumulating dead organisms,producing dead organisms,,Mushrooms gain their energy from decomposing dead organisms. Explain why a mushroom is not a plant.
9,What allows some things to enter the cell while keeping other things out?,,cell membrane,cell substrate,cell center,cell vacuum,,"This window screen has a fly on it. In a way, the window screen is like a cell membrane. It lets some things pass through while keeping other things out. Air molecules and raindrops can pass through the screen, but larger objects like the fly cannot. In the first lesson of this chapter, you'll learn about different ways that substances can pass through the cell membrane. You'll find out how the cell membrane lets some substances pass through while keeping other substances out."
10,What is telomere shortening associated with?,,aging,sleeping,reducing,changing,,"Telomerase is not active in adult somatic cells. Adult somatic cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened. This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. In 2010, scientists found [1] that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice, and this may have potential in regenerative medicine. Mariella Jaskelioff, et al. , “Telomerase reactivation reverses tissue degeneration in aged telomerase-deficient mice,” Nature, 469 (2011):102–7."
11,"Which  organs control the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine?",,kidneys,lungs,tongue,ears,,"The kidneys play many vital roles in homeostasis. They filter all the blood in the body many times each day and produce a total of about 1.5 liters of urine. The kidneys control the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine. The kidneys also secrete hormones that help maintain homeostasis. Erythropoietin, for example, is a kidney hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when more are needed. The kidneys themselves are also regulated by hormones. For example, antidiuretic hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the kidneys to produce more concentrated urine when the body is low on water."
12,A ramp is a type of simple machine called what?,,inclined plane,extension plane,allow plane,rough plane,,"Look at the ramp in the Figure below . A ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane. It can be used to raise an object off the ground. The input distance is the length of the sloped surface of the ramp. This is the distance over which the input force is applied. The output distance is the height of the ramp, or the vertical distance the object is raised. For this ramp, the input distance is 6 m and the output distance is 2 meters. Therefore, the ideal mechanical advantage of this ramp is:."
13,What are the small molecules or proteins produced by bacteria that regulate gene expression?,,autoinducers,fluxes,protazoas,sporozoans,,Figure 9.17 Autoinducers are small molecules or proteins produced by bacteria that regulate gene expression.
14,What is the term for the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past?,,fossils,corals,bones,detritis,,"Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past. The soft parts of organisms almost always decompose quickly after death. On occasion, the hard parts—mainly bones, teeth, or shells—remain long enough to mineralize and form fossils. An example of a complete fossil skeleton is shown in Figure below . The fossil record is the record of life that unfolded over four billion years and pieced back together through the analysis of fossils."
15,What do we call a simple machine that consists of a rope and grooved wheel?,,pulley,axle,lever,pedal,,A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a rope and grooved wheel. Single pulleys may be fixed or moveable. Single and moveable pulleys may be combined in a compound pulley. The ideal mechanical advantage of a pulley or compound pulley is always equal to or greater than 1. Fixed pulleys and some compound pulleys also change the direction of the input force.

18,"Foodborne illness, food allergies, or a food intolerance cause symptoms in what system?",,digestive,respiratory,circulatory,skeletal,,"Most of the time, you probably aren’t aware of your digestive system. It works well without causing any problems. But most people have problems with their digestive system at least once in a while. Did you ever eat something that didn’t “agree” with you? Maybe you had a stomachache or felt sick to your stomach? Maybe you had diarrhea? These could be symptoms of foodborne illness, food allergies, or a food intolerance."
19,"Inside female cones, female spores develop into female what?",,gametophytes,gymnosperms,filaments,tubules,,"Cones form on a mature sporophyte plant. Inside male cones, male spores develop into male gametophytes. Each male gametophyte consists of several cells enclosed within a grain of pollen . Inside female cones, female spores develop into female gametophytes. Each female gametophyte produces an egg inside an ovule."
20,The lens and other parts of the eye work together to focus a real image on what eye structure?,,retina,iris,pupil,cornea,,"As just described, the eyes collect and focus visible light. The lens and other structures of the eye work together to focus a real image on the retina. The image is upside-down and reduced in size, as you can see in Figure below . The image reaches the brain as electrical signals that travel through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the signals as shape, color, and brightness. It also interprets the image as though it were right-side up. The brain does this automatically, so what we see is always right-side up. The brain also “tells” us what we are seeing."
21,What do you call the basic units of the structure and function of living things?,,cells,molecules,enzymes,proteins,,"If you look at living matter with a microscope—even a simple light microscope—you will see that it consists of cells. Cells are the basic units of the structure and function of living things. They are the smallest units that can carry out the processes of life. All organisms are made up of one or more cells, and all cells have many of the same structures and carry out the same basic life processes. Knowing the structures of cells and the processes they carry out is necessary to understanding life itself."
22,"""incident"" and ""reflected"" are two types of what?",,rays,cells,mirrors,collisions,,"In the Figure below , you can see how both types of reflection occur. Waves of light are represented by arrows called rays. Rays that strike the surface are referred to as incident rays, and rays that reflect off the surface are known as reflected rays. In regular reflection, all the rays are reflected in the same direction. This explains why regular reflection forms a clear image. In diffuse reflection, the rays are reflected in many different directions. This is why diffuse reflection forms, at best, a blurry image. You can see animations of both types of reflection at this URL: http://toolboxes. flexiblelearning. net. au/demosites/series5/508/Laboratory/StudyNotes/snReflectionMirrors. htm."
23,What is the name of the molecule which has one carbon and four hydrogen atoms?,,methane,carbohydrate,sulfur,carbon monoxide,,Hydrocarbons are made of carbon and hydrogen atoms. This molecule with one carbon and four hydrogen atoms is methane.
24,What is required to move or change matter from one state to another?,,energy,food,gravity,evolution,,"Energy provides the ability to move or change matter from one state to another (for example, from solid to liquid). Every living thing needs energy to live and grow. Your body gets its energy from food, but that is only a small part of the energy you use every day. Cooking your food takes energy, and so does keeping it cold in the refrigerator or the freezer. The same is true for heating or cooling your home. Whether you are turning on a light in the kitchen or riding in a car to school, you are using energy. Billions of people all around the world use energy, so there is a huge demand for resources to provide all of this energy. Why do we need so much energy? The main reason is that almost everything that happens on Earth involves energy."
25,"When a stream or river slows down, it starts dropping its what?",,sediments,fragments,organisms,pollutants,,"When a stream or river slows down, it starts dropping its sediments.

30,What is the most abundant metal of the earth's crust?,,aluminum,calcium,copper,magnetite,,"Metals represent approximately 25% of the elemental makeup of the Earth's crust. The bulk of these metals, primarily aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, are typically found in combined form. The most abundant metal is aluminum, which occurs almost exclusively as the ionic mineral bauxite. The other most common metals, including iron, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, are also found primarily as the cationic portion of an ionic compound. Very few metals actually occur naturally as pure substances. The ones that do are often referred to as precious or semi-precious metals."
31,What is the name of the first stage of photosynthesis?,,light reactions,consumption,absorption,contamination,,"The first stage of photosynthesis is called the light reactions. During this stage, light is absorbed and transformed to chemical energy in the bonds of NADPH and ATP. You can follow the process in the Figure below as you read about it below."
32,The primary motor cortex is located in which lobe of the brain?,,frontal,Parietal,Temporal lobe,Occipital,,"Primary Motor Cortex The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. A neurosurgeon, Walter Penfield, described much of the basic understanding of the primary motor cortex by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebrum. Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that he could observe responses to the stimulation. This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. We now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction. The primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see Figure 14.23). The neurons responsible for musculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure. The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. Also, the relative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest amount of cortical space is given to muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers and the lower face. The “power muscles” that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex."
33,"Horny ridges on the jaws serve the same function as what, for turtles?",,teeth,skin,taste buds,hairs,,"Turtles may appear slow and harmless when they are out of the water, but in the water is another story. Turtles can be either herbivores or carnivores, with most sea turtles carnivorous . Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous, or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does have some limitations. Sea turtles typically feed on jellyfish, sponges and other soft-bodied organisms. Some species of sea turtle with stronger jaws eat shellfish, while other species, such as the green sea turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated ridges that help them cut through tough plants."
34,What do you call the study of how organisms interact with their environment and each other?,,ecology,biology,biochemistry,climatology,,"Most biological sciences are specialized areas of study. Biology includes biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, immunology, genetics, physiology, zoology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and botany. Biochemistry is the study of the chemicals that make up life. Cell biology is the study of life at the level of the cell. Microbiology is the study of microscopic organisms. Immunology is the study of an organism's resistance to disease. Genetics is the study of how organisms pass traits to their offspring. The study of how the human body works is called physiology. Zoology is the study of animals. The study of how organisms interact with their environment and each other is called ecology. Evolutionary biology is the study of how populations and species change over time. Botany is the study of plants. The four unifying principles are important foundations for each and every field of biology. Applied fields of biology such as medicine and genetic research involve many specialized areas of study."
35,The strength of a base depends on the concentration of _______ it produces when dissolved in water?,,hydroxide ions,combustion ions,calcium ions,monoxide ions,,"The strength of a base depends on the concentration of hydroxide ions it produces when dissolved in water. For example, sodium hydroxide completely breaks down into ions in water, so it is a strong base. However, only a fraction of ammonia breaks down into ions, so it is a weak base."
36,"Specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells determine what, which is important in cases of transfusion?",,blood type,blood count,blood amount,blood form,,Specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells determine blood type. The best-known blood types are ABO and Rhesus (Rh) blood types. Blood type is important in cases of blood transfusion. A patient must receive blood of his or her own blood type to avoid clumping of red blood cells.
37,"Exothermic reactions, like all chemical reactions, require what to get started?",,activation energy,surface energy,membrane energy,specific energy,,"All chemical reactions, including exothermic reactions, need activation energy to get started."
38,"Exemplified by sea stars and sand dollars, echinoderms have a calcareous structure developed by pigment cells and made of ossicles, which is called what?",,endoskeleton,hydrostatic skeleton,exoskeleton,thorax,,"Phylum Echinodermata Echinodermata are so named owing to their spiny skin (from the Greek “echinos” meaning “spiny” and “dermos” meaning “skin”), and this phylum is a collection of about 7,000 described living species. Echinodermata are exclusively marine organisms. Sea stars (Figure 28.44), sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms. To date, no freshwater or terrestrial echinoderms are known. Morphology and Anatomy Adult echinoderms exhibit pentaradial symmetry and have a calcareous endoskeleton made of ossicles, although the early larval stages of all echinoderms have bilateral symmetry. The endoskeleton is developed by epidermal cells and may possess pigment cells, giving vivid colors to these animals, as well as cells laden with toxins. Gonads are present in each arm. In echinoderms like sea stars, every arm bears two rows of tube feet on the oral side. These tube feet help in attachment to the substratum. These animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system. An interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate, even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost."
